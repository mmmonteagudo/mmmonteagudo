- 👋 Hi, I’m Marvin.  I'm a Web Developer / IT Professor / Grad Student who likes to create web apps and teach young students to do the same.
- 👋 I'm married to my college sweetheart and blessed to have a son, who is in the Autism Spectrum, but nonetheless surprises us with everyday miracles.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new development stacks in LEMP and MERN, as well as mobile development using Flutter.  All those, in addition to the doctorate degree that I am trying to attain in the near future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will someday benefit children who are within the Autism Spectrum, as well as those that work and care for them.
